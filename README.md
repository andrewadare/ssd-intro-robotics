This repo contains examples and demos for the Intro to Robotics class at the Boulder Hackerspace.

Certain classes and functions are provided by a single importable module called `ssd_robotics`. To make this name visible to your python interpreter, run `pip3 install -e .`. To test the installation, try `import ssd_robotics` in a python REPL session or notebook.

More material will be added here as we continue through the class, so check back regularly.
